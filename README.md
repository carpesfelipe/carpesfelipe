## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Felipe. Iâ€™m studying Computer Engineering at UFES at the moment.
I'm currently learning about concepts like blockchaim,smart contracts and Web3.
My interests as a developer in this area are to create another possible path to my carreer and improve, which I think is a very promissing and expanding tecnology field.
